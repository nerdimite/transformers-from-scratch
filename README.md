# Transformers From Scratch
Transformers have disrupted the field of Deep Learning in both NLP and Vision. It has become a general computation neural network which can be applied almost anywhere. While applying them to any use case has become easier than ever with libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, I wanted to dig deeper and understand all the nitty gritties of how they work. In this repository I learn to implement Transformers from Scratch using PyTorch.
